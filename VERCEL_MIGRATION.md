# Database Migration for Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, you'll need to set up your database schema. This document explains how to run migrations after deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. Your application is deployed to Vercel
2. You have a Neon.tech PostgreSQL database set up
3. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set in your Vercel project settings

## Running Migrations

### Method 1: Using Vercel CLI

You can run migrations using the Vercel CLI from your local machine:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to your Vercel account:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Link to your project:
   ```
   vercel link
   ```

4. Run migration command with production environment variables:
   ```
   vercel env pull .env.production
   DATABASE_URL=$(grep DATABASE_URL .env.production | cut -d '=' -f 2-) npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

### Method 2: Using Vercel Console

You can also run migrations directly from the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Deployments" â†’ Select the latest deployment
4. Click on "Functions" tab
5. Click on "Console" in the top right
6. Run the migration command:
   ```
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

## Verifying Migration

After running migrations, you can verify that your tables were created correctly:

1. Go to your Neon.tech dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor"
4. Run the following SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

This should show all the tables in your database, including:
- `users`
- `videos`
- `video_summaries`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with migrations:

1. Check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set
2. Ensure your Neon.tech database is accessible from Vercel
3. Try running migrations locally first to debug any schema issues
4. Check Vercel logs for any specific error messages
